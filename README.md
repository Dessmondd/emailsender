# emailsender

Hey, this is Dessmondd.

This is a pretty basic email sender made on Python.
Just change the variables to whatever details you want, make sure that any gmail account that you use have permissions for be use in third party apps just like this one or otherwise email won't go thru and would show up a error.
If you wanna do that:

- Go to your email settings in Gmail.
- Go to your security tab.
- Turn on access under the "Less secure apps" tab.

Enjoy!
